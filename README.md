# GuessANumber
This is a simple console-based number guessing game implemented in Java. The game allows users to guess a randomly generated number based on a selected difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, and it ends either when the user guesses correctly or exhausts the allowed number of attempts.

Features:
Difficulty Levels:

Easy: Number range 1-50

Medium: Number range 1-100

Hard: Number range 1-500

Feedback System: The user is given feedback if their guess is too high or too low.

Game Flow: The game allows the player to play multiple rounds, with an option to restart after each round.

Guess Limit: Users have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number. After exceeding this, the correct number is revealed.

How It Works:
The game asks the user to select a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.

A random number within the appropriate range (based on difficulty) is generated.

The user is given 5 chances to guess the number.

After each incorrect guess, the program informs the user if the guess was too high or too low.

If the user guesses the number correctly or runs out of attempts, the game ends and the option to play again is given.
